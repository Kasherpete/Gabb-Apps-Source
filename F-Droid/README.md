# Overview
[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) is an open-source "package Manager" that is used by [Gabb](https://gabb.com/) to install packages remotely from their servers.
This source code *IS NOT* the Gabb flavor of F-Droid, but the [privileged extension](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.fdroid.fdroid.privileged/) that is needed to install packages
from a "known installer" since the Gabb Phone Z2 does not allow installs from external, unidentified
publishers/installers. The Eth0s team is able to find the physical app on the phone, but not the main F-Droid app. 
We believe that F-Droid is in the form of the Package Installer app that is on the phone, as it is an external app 
that is not on the phone by default. This information will be revealed once we get the source code for Package Installer.
