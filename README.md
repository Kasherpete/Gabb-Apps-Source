# Overview

This is a public archive of all source code that can be obtained from the
[Gabb Phone Z2](https://gabb.com/product/gabb-phone-z2/). This will be updated as more APKs are decompiled.
***UPDATE: Since there are too many files for git to handle, there is now a [google drive right here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15k22DK06IEitFJinsJzzXoaoEkso4Ik4?usp=sharing)

### Current list of apps:
* [F-Droid Privileged Extension](https://github.com/Kasherpete/Gabb-Apps-Source/tree/main/data/F-Droid)
* [PackageUpdater](https://github.com/Kasherpete/Gabb-Apps-Source/tree/main/data/PackageUpdater/README.md)

Hopefully we can get all apps but here is a list of the ones most important:
- [ ] GabbID
