# Overview

This is a public archive of all source code that can be obtained from the
[Gabb Phone Z2](https://gabb.com/product/gabb-phone-z2/). This will be updated as more APKs are decompiled.
***UPDATE: Since there are too many files for git to handle, there is now a [google drive right here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15k22DK06IEitFJinsJzzXoaoEkso4Ik4?usp=sharing). THIS HAS MUCH MORE DATA***

#### NOTE: Everything in the data folder is from the gabb phone Z2 and legacy data is from the Gabb Phone Plus.

### ~~Current list of apps:~~
* ~~[F-Droid Privileged Extension](https://github.com/Kasherpete/Gabb-Apps-Source/tree/main/data/F-Droid)~~
* ~~[PackageUpdater](https://github.com/Kasherpete/Gabb-Apps-Source/tree/main/data/PackageUpdater/README.md)~~
* **We have all apps from the Z2 in the legacy data folder in Google Drive**

### Current apps to get:
Hopefully we can get all apps but here is a list of the ones most important:
- [x] GabbID
- [x] MyGabb
- [x] Gabb Services
- [x] F-Droid
- [x] Package Updater
